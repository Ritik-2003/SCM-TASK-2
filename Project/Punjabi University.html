                        Punjab Assembly established Punjabi University, Patiala under the Punjab Act No. 35 of 1961. Dr.
                        S. Radhakrishnan, the then President of India laid foundation of Punjabi University on June 24,
                        1962. He preached, "The institutes of higher education share the burden of nation-building in a
                        critically important sense. Our aim is a strong, free and democratic India where every citizen
                        has an equal place and full opportunity of growth. In this task, a vast responsibility rests on
                        our universities." Established on April 30, 1962 in the erstwhile princely state of Patiala with
                        the main objective of furthering the cause of Punjabi language, art and literature, Punjabi
                        University has since evolved into the largest University in the state. This is the second
                        University in the world to be named after a language, the first being Hebrew University of
                        Israel. Its vision is to establish and incorporate a University for the advancement of Punjabi
                        studies and development of Punjabi language as a medium of instruction or otherwise for
                        providing instruction in humanistic and scientific subjects and generally for the promotion of
                        education and research. The University started working from its present lush green, pollution
                        free, 316 acres campus since 1965.

                        <span class="read-more-text"><br><br>

                            Initially University's jurisdiction area was fixed as the 16 km radius having only 9
                            colleges. In 1969, it grew into an affiliating university, with 43 colleges affiliated to
                            it. Now the university caters to the educational needs of nine Districts of Punjab. Over the
                            time since its inception, the University has evolved into a multi-faceted and multi-faculty
                            educational institution for the promotion of higher education and research in Humanities,
                            Arts, Sciences, Engineering Languages, Technology and many more. Spread over 600 acres of
                            land, its 1500+ teachers are imparting instruction and guidance to nearly 14,000+ students
                            in a multi-faceted, multi-pronged and multi-faculty environment comprising 70+ Teaching and
                            Research Departments/Chairs on its Campus, 27 Regional Centre/ Neighbourhood
