                        Adesh Polytechnic College is approved by All India Council for Technical Education / Pharmacy
                        Council of India, New Delhi and affiliated with Punjab State Board of Technical Education &
                        Industrial Training, Chandigarh.<br><br>

                        It is the mission of the College to engage students of uncommon promise in an intense full-time
                        education of their minds, exploration of their creative faculties and development of their
                        social and leadership abilities, in a three-year course of study and residence that concludes
                        with a baccalaureate degree in the liberal arts.<br>

                           vision. "Literary institutions are founded and endowed for the common good, and not for the private advantage of those who resort to them. . . but that their mental powers may be cultivated and improved for the benefit of society" (Our Chairman Dr. H.S. Gill's inaugural address); "To lose yourself in generous enthusiasms and cooperate with others for common ends: this is the offer of the College". The second idea stresses the formation of a complete individual for a world Two guiding ideas suffuse A.P.C.'s mission. The first defines education in terms of a social  in flux: there is an intrinsic value in a liberal arts education of breadth and depth, beyond the acquisition of specific knowledge, that will enable a thinking person, "to be at home in all lands and all ages".<br><br>

                            At the root of this mission is selection. First, and regardless of their wealth, A.P.C. selects men and women of varied gifts, diverse social, geographic and racial backgrounds, and exceptional qualities of mind and character. Developed in association with one another, these gifts will enable them to become leaders in many fields of endeavor. Second, it recruits faculty members of high intellectual ability and scholarly accomplishment who have a passion for education both of undergraduates and of themselves, as life-long creators and pursuers of knowledge.
